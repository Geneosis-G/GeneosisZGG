What do you do when you find a strange object with a big red button on it in the center of a little crater in your garden? You press the big red button of course :D

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Many people mentioned the possibility to make a some kind of low gravity device, and I realized recently that I knew how to do that so when Steve's Wolf suggested a "floating goat" I decided to add this mod to my to-do list :)
Nothing special to say about the code of this mod: every object have a property called "gravity scale" so I just changed it to a really low value to simulate zero gravity ^^
